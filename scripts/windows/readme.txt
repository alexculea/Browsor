Install notes
==============================

The setup.ps1 file takes care of installing the program. As this is a PowerShell script,
you need to configure your machine to allow to execute it, if you haven't did that already.

To allow PS script execution:
- Open PowerShell as Administrator
- Inside the console run: Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
- Select key A to save for all and press enter

To install, right click the setup.ps1 file and select Run with PowerShell.
Tu uninstall, run the same setup file.
