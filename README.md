# Browser Selector - desktop app for Windows 10

A tool that registers as the default system browser prompting you to select one of the installed ones to open the URL. Works whenever you open a link from any desktop app.

## Use cases
  - Use multiple browser profiles on the fly, eg: work vs personal
  - Test different browser versions, betas, development, etc
  - Choose everytime based on what web apps are known to work best on, such as Google services in Chrome

## Installation (only manual for now) 
Prerequisites: [Rust compiler](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started)

### 1. In any PowerShell terminal at the root of the repository, run:


```PowerShell
# build exe
cargo build --release

# make install folder in %APPDATA% (note: works with any other location)
mkdir $env:APPDATA\BrowserSelector 

# copy exe and scripts to install folder
cp .\target\release\browser-selector.exe $env:APPDATA\BrowserSelector
cp .\scripts\windows\* $env:APPDATA\BrowserSelector


# Starts an elevated terminal at install location
Start-Process Powershell -Verb runAs -ArgumentList '-noexit -command cd $env:APPDATA\BrowserSelector'

```

Switch to the newly opened **admin powershell** for the rest of the commands

```Powershell
# Allow running unsigned powershell scripts (https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170)
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted

# Runs the install
.\install.ps

# For security, revert the policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Default

# To uninstall, run (needs elevated console):
./install.ps --uninstall
```

### 2. Set default browser:

Open Settings (ðŸªŸ + I) > Apps > Default Apps > Browser selector > Set default

Note: You might need to reboot in order to see the program listed as a browser in the system.
